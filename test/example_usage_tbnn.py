    This function loads the pre-processed data containing invariants (x),
    tensor basis (tb), mean velocity gradient (gradu), Reynolds stress
    anisotropy (b), turbulent kinetic energy (tke), specific dissipationand
    rate (omega), eddy viscosity (nut), and computational cell volume (vol).
    We have three distinct flows and 10k points per flow. They are jets in
    crossflow with 3 distinct velocity ratios r described in the following paper:
    
    Milani et al. "Enriching MRI mean flow data of inclined jets in 
    crossflow with Large Eddy Simulations". Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 2019.
    
    Note that the data contains mostly LES variables, but the values of nut 
    and omega employed to produce the data come from a 
    k-omega SST simulation run with the LES velocity field in 
    the LES mesh. This is described in detail in my PhD thesis 
    (https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.27377.30566)
